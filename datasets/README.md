This folder is for managing the datasets that will be used for the training.

Run clean_dataset.py first before running datasets_util.py. The datasets_util.py will preprocess the dataset and split it to test, train, and val. In this case, the original dataset folder name is "raw-diamond-images." 
After running the said preprocessing file, a folder named "diamond_dataset" will be generated, which will be then used for the training later on.
